# python-bank
I am writing the ['bank' practice tech test](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/individual_challenges/bank_tech_test.md) to learn Python. While I have familiarised myself with the Python syntax in the past, I have never written test driven code to complete a project in this language.

This readme will be updated with approach, testing architecture information &c as I complete the task.
